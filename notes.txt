Optimal ARIMA parameters are (5,2,5) with AIC of -7869.766

AIC score is an member of ARIMA class from statsmodels library
AIC = 2k - 2ln(L^)
where k = number of estimated parameters in the model
L^ = maximum value of the likelihood function for the model

N-Beats 
- designed for univariate time series forecasting
- deep neural network composed entirely of fully-connected layers arranged into a system of blocks and stacks, utilizing a doubly-residual stacking principle

TFT - Temporal Fusion Transformer

RNAForecaster — ODE‑based transcriptomic forecasting
A neural ODE‑based model that learns continuous gene expression dynamics and predicts future transcriptional states. It’s been applied to gene expression forecasting specifically rather than generic time series

RVAgene — recurrent VAE for gene expression dynamics

A recurrent variational autoencoder tailored for gene expression time courses. It learns latent representations of temporal gene profiles and can generate future expression trajectories.
