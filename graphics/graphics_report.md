## Key Insights

### Model Performance Summary
The analysis reveals significant differences in model performance:

- **Naive Model**: Provides baseline performance with constant predictions
- **ARIMA Models**: Show varying stability depending on data characteristics
- **Neural Networks**: May exhibit instability in generative forecasting mode
- **Traditional ML**: Performance varies based on feature engineering quality

### Temporal Patterns
The banded analysis reveals how model performance changes over different time periods, 
helping identify:
- Periods of high/low predictability
- Model stability over time
- Adaptation to changing data patterns

### Forecasting Behavior
The comprehensive analysis shows:
- How models handle recursive prediction (using only their own outputs)
- Stability and divergence patterns in extrapolation mode
- Relationship between actual and predicted values across different scales
